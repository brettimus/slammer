#Come on and slam

Slammer is a lightweight (at least it tries to be) slider written in vanilla JS with [Hammer](http://hammerjs.github.io/) to provide touch support.

Gonna use CSS transitions. JS fallbacks someday? I don't need awesome browser support for the first version.

Default CSS is responsive because I'm not a jerk.
