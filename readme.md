#Come on and slam

Slammer is a lightweight (at least it tries to be) slider written in vanilla JS with [Hammer](http://hammerjs.github.io/) to provide touch support.

Gonna use CSS transitions. JS fallbacks someday? I don't need awesome browser support for the first version.

Default CSS is responsive because I'm not a jerk.


##Getting started

If you just want to use it, all you need is `slammer.js` and `hammer.js`. **Note: I think the prod-dist version of this should even have the option of one pre-concatenated file?**

If you want to dev with it:

- `npm install`
- in top level: `grunt watch`
- in top level: `http-server`
- ???
- profit
